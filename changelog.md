-   status on whole procedure:
    -   getting smooth end-of spectral function.
        However the fucntion is not zero at the endpoints $r=0$ and $r=R$. So looking at different functions of the procedure and changing obvious mistakes. One of which is:
-   add fourier function. Fourier, not fft, needs to be done.

-   finish classic pod
    -   form symmetric correlation in $r,r'$.
